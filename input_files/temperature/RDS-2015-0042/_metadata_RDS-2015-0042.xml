      <abstract>The data included consist of daily climatic information recorded at five climate stations at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in Macon County, North Carolina, USA: CS01, CS17, CS21, CS28, and CS77. These stations are operated by the Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service. Data include daily air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure (CS01 only), wind speed and direction, photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD), and solar radiation from 1983 through 2021 (starting year varies per climate station).</abstract>
      <purpose>The Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory was established in 1934 and is world-renowned for its research in forest hydrology. Coweeta was established to determine the fundamental effects of forest management on soil and water resources and to serve as a testing ground for theories in forest hydrology. To facilitate this, a network of climate and precipitation stations was established across the site. The research program has since expanded its focus to encompass watershed ecosystem science. The original climate and precipitation network continues to facilitate these studies and serves as the foundation of the long-term data record.</purpose>

Additional minor metadata updates were made on 09/06/2019. On 01/27/2020 data were updated to include 2019 measurements. On 03/02/2021 measurements for 2020 were added and some additional metadata updates were also made. Data for 2021 were added on 03/03/2022. Minor metadata edits were made on 07/06/2022.

        <methdesc>Digital daily air temperature data have been recorded at the main climate station (CS01) continuously since 1983. In addition to CS01, there are four climate stations across the basin (CS17, CS21, CS28, and CS77). Each of these stations continually measures and records (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) the following variables every 60 seconds: temperature and relative humidity in an open field (HMP45c, EE181 - Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA), photosynthetically active photon flux density (LI-190, Campbell Scientific or Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA), as well as wind speed and wind direction at canopy height (014A and 024A, C034B, C034E MetOne Instruments, Grants Pass, OR, USA). Barometric air pressure (Vaisala CS106, Campbell Scientific) as well as solar radiation (model 8–48, Eppley Lab, Inc., Newport, RI, USA). Data retrieval from the climate network is via wireless remote access. All data recorded to the CR1000 datalogger are transmitted via radio frequency (Freewave Technologies, Inc., FGR-115RC, Boulder, CO) from each of the climate stations to a computer server in the data processing office.</methdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Hourly averaging is done by the data logger and downloaded weekly. Daily averages are calculated on a monthly basis (from the 24 hourly averages) when the datasets are assembled and stored on the local server. Similarly, the minimum and maximum represent the absolute minimum or maximum 60 second measurement for each day.

Wind speed and direction are obtained a little differently. In vector averaging, either the orthogonal components of the wind are measured directly with a wind instrument or the speed and direction are measured with an anemometer and a wind vane and then they are used to derive the orthogonal components. To obtain the vector-averaged speed and direction, the components are summed and vector averaged at the end of the averaging time.

\Data\csXX_daily.csv (where XX = climate station number 01, 17, 21, 28, or 77)

These data contains daily climate data collected at the specified climate station (csXX) at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. Data were recorded every 60 seconds and averaged for the hour, what is included in this file is the average (or minimum/maximum as noted) of those hourly data for each day. 

YEAR = Calendar year of recorded measurement.

MONTH = Month of recorded measurement.

DAY = Day of recorded measurement.

TMIN = Daily minimum air temperature in °Celsius (C).
TMAX = Daily maximum air temperature in °C.
TAVG = Daily average air temperature in °C.
	
RHMIN = Daily minimum relative humidity as a % (0-100)*.
RHMAX = Daily maximum relative humidity as a % (0-100)*.	
RHAVG = Daily average relative humidity as a % (0-100)*.	

VPMIN = Minimum daily saturation air vapor pressure (datalogger calculates this based on air temperature and relative humidity according to Lowe [1977]) in millibars (mb).
VPMAX = Maximum daily saturation air vapor pressure (datalogger calculates this based on air temperature and relative humidity according to Lowe [1977]) in mb.
VPAVG = Average daily saturation air vapor pressure (datalogger calculates this based on air temperature and relative humidity according to Lowe [1977]) in mb.

WIND = Daily average wind speed in meters per second.
W_DIR = Mean wind direction (azimuth, 0-360 degrees).

PPFD = Photosynthetically Active Photon Flux Density in micromoles of photons per meter squared per second.

TOTALSOLAR = Total Solar Radiation in langleys (measurements begin in 2016 at CS17, CS21, CS28, and CS77).

AVG_B_PRESS = Hourly air Barometric Pressure in kilopascals (kPa) (only available for CS01).

*NOTE: There are a few relative humitidy (RH) values that were recorded as &gt; 100. We concluded it was best to leave the data as recorded, but those data points should really be 100.</eaover>
